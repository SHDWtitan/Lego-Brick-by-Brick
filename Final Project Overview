1. Final Project Overview
Your final project is an end-to-end data exploration and visualization project. You will choose or collect a dataset, clean and analyze it using Python (e.g., Pandas/Numpy), and communicate meaningful findings through polished visualizations or use an interactive dashboard to let users explore the data.

This project represents the culmination of the course's three core dimensions. Aim to deepen at least two, ideally all three, of these dimensions.:

Data Collection & Processing
Collect or select meaningful data. Clean, merge, transform, and prepare the dataset with Python.

Analysis & Insights

Ask focused questions and explore your dataset using methods such as:

summary statistics, trends, distributions

comparisons across groups or time

correlations or relationships

segmenting or filtering to reveal patterns

Your goal is to move beyond description and provide meaningful and interpretable insights.

Interactive Visualization / Storytelling

Produce polished charts or build a simple interactive dashboard using:

Altair (in notebook)

Vega-Lite (HTML)

Optional Flask backend to serve data

2. Deliverables
A. Final Notebook and/or Prototype + Code (20 pts)
(Upload as a ZIP file — 20 pts)

Your ZIP file must contain all files needed to reproduce your work. It should include:

1. Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Full workflow from start to finish

Data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and visualization steps

Clear markdown explanations and commentary

Code must run top-to-bottom without errors

2. Dataset(s)

Include one of the following:

Cleaned CSV/JSON/XLSX files used in the final analysis

OR a link to a public dataset (if not downloadable)

If you collected or scraped data: include your data collection script(s)

3. Visualizations or Dashboard Files

Depending on your project format:

If Notebook Report:

All visualizations must be rendered inside the notebook

If Interactive Dashboard:

HTML file(s) and any required JS/CSS

Vega-Lite spec files (if separate)

Optional Flask app folder (if used)

4. Supporting Scripts (if applicable)

Data scraping/collection scripts

Helper Python modules

Any utility functions

5. README (README.md)

A short guide explaining:

How to run your notebook or dashboard

Any installation steps (minimal)

Dataset sources

Explanation of the folder/file structure

B. Final Video Presentation (3-4 minutes) (5 pts)
Submit an unlisted YouTube link to your recorded video (3–4 minutes) that summarizes:

Your topic and motivation

Your dataset and key processing steps

Your main insights

Your final visualizations or dashboard

A screen recording with voiceover is sufficient.
Submit the video link on Webcourses (just comment).

 

3. Project Expectations
Strong projects contribute across three areas:

1. Data Collection & Processing
(collect meaningful data, clean it, prepare it for analysis)

2. Analysis & Insights
(ask focused questions, uncover patterns, interpret results with care)

3. Interactive Visualization
(design interactions or visual storytelling that supports exploration and explanation)

Aim to deepen at least two, ideally all three, of these dimensions.

Academic Integrity:
Your work must be your own. External code may be adapted with citation. Do not submit pre-made dashboards or AI-generated datasets without disclosure.
